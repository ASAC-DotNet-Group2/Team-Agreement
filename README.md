#### Approach to the day-to-day work

We will have meetings on a daily basis on 9:30 am to discuss the tasks for each day and review the updates so that each member understands the goal for everyday. We will have 10-minutes breaks each hour till 1:30 pm, and we will have a meeting at 5:00 pm to review the work of the day.

## Conflict Plan

+ What will be your groupâ€™s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

 With each conflict we are going to face, we will take a vote and decide what to do depending on the majority.
 
+ What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

 We as a group have decided that this will be a group project and the tasks will be handed evenly between the team members, and all of us agree on this.
 
+ How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

 Using multiple online platforms, we will be communicating remotely and it will be as effective as face to face meetings. Team work makes dream work, whenever a member facing a problem due to his understanding/skill level, the other team members will be there to help him understand the problem and solve it.

+ How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing & how and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
 
 Each team member will get three warnings from the team leader and if the member refuses to cooperate, we will report this issue to the lead instructor of the course.
 
## Communication Plan

The team will be available from 9:30 am to 1:30 pm and from 5:00 pm to 11:59 pm, we will be using Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp to communicate with each other. We will take 10 minutes breaks each hour. Our plan is to stay up late if we start to fall behind until we finish the tasks. Each member's opinion will be taken into consideration and the team members will vote on the matter. One of the team leader's responsibilties will be that everybody is polite and good with each other, and any problem that escalates, will be reported to the lead instructor.

## Work Plan

As the project moves forward, tasks will be much easier to identify, and depending on how the project flows, tasks will be assigned to each member depending on their skills. There will be a daily meeting to review the work and check if the requierments are met.
